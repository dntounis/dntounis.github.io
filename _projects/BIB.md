# Beam-Induced Background Studies for Future Electron-Positron Colliders

## Project Overview
This ongoing study aims to evaluate the impact of beam-induced backgrounds on detector performance for future electron-positron colliders, with particular focus on validating the Silicon Detector (SiD) concept's compatibility with the Cool Copper Collider (C³) beam parameters.

## Technical Approach
In this analysis, we implement the following simulation chain:

### Background Generation
- Simulation of electron-positron pair production using the GUINEA-PIG PIC simulator
- Modeling of photoproduced hadrons from beam-beam interactions with a dedicated generator
- Full characterization of background particle distributions and kinematics

### Detector Simulation
- Detailed modeling of the SiD detector geometry and response using the Key4HEP software stack
- Tracking the simulated background particles trough the SiD detector and registering energy deposits (or "hits") in the various detector subsystems.

### Performance Evaluation
- Quantification of hit densities and occupancy levels in:
  - Vertex detector
  - Silicon tracker
  - Electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters
- Assessment of timing distributions of background hits
- Analysis of background energy deposition patterns

## Key Objectives
The study aims to:
- Validate the compatibility of the SiD detector, originally developed for the International Linear Collider (ILC),  with the beam parameters envisaged for C³.
- Evaluate timing requirements for background rejection
- Assess impact on trigger and readout systems
- Guide detector design optimizations

## Expected Outcomes
With this work nearing completion, we eventually aim to provide: 

- Quantitative assessment of background levels throughout SiD
- Validation of detector technologies for C³ conditions
- Guidelines for detector timing and readout specifications
- Input for future detector optimization studies

The results will be crucial for demonstrating the feasibility of the SiD concept for future electron-positron colliders and guiding potential design modifications.
