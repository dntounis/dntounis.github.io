As we plan the next generation of particle colliders, environmental considerations have become increasingly crucial. My research focuses on evaluating the environmental impact of the Cool Copper Collider (C³), a proposed electron-positron collider designed for detailed studies of the Higgs boson.

The study addresses several key aspects:
- Comprehensive analysis of carbon emissions from both construction and operation phases
- Development of innovative strategies to minimize environmental impact
- Creation of a new metric for comparing different Higgs factory proposals, incorporating:
 - Physics research potential
 - Energy consumption
 - Construction and operational carbon footprint
- Assessment of C³'s unique features that reduce environmental impact:
 - Compact 8 km footprint (compared to >20 km for other proposals)
 - Cut-and-cover construction technique reducing embodied carbon
 - Advanced energy efficiency technologies

Our research demonstrates how modern accelerator design can balance scientific ambition with environmental responsibility. The framework developed in this study provides a quantitative basis for evaluating and comparing different collider proposals from a sustainability perspective, while maintaining focus on their primary physics goals.

This work contributes to the broader discussion of sustainability in big science projects and helps establish environmental impact as a key metric in future accelerator design decisions.
