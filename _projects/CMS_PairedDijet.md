As an undergraduate student, I contributed to a search for ultra-heavy new particles with the full Run 2 data of the CMS experiment. In that analysis, we looked for TeV-scale resonances $Y$ decaying to two identical heavy particles $X$, with each one of them decaying hadronically to two resolved jets:  $pp \rightarrow Y \rightarrow XX \rightarrow (jj)(jj)$. A few candidate events were observed in the data, with a maximum local (global) significance of 4.2(1.6)$\sigma$.
