# Searching for New Physics Through Paired Dijet Resonances at the LHC

## Project Overview

As an undergraduate student, I contributed to a search for ultra-heavy new particles with the full Run 2 data of the CMS experiment, representing 138 fb⁻¹ of proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV. In that analysis, we looked for new massive particles beyond the Standard Model, in the form of TeV-scale resonances $Y$ decaying to two identical heavy particles $X$, with each one of them decaying hadronically to two  jets - collimated sprays of particles that are the hallmark signatures of quarks and gluons. This creates a distinctive four-jet signature:  $pp \rightarrow Y \rightarrow XX \rightarrow (jj)(jj)$. A few candidate events were observed in the data, with a maximum local (global) significance of 3.9(1.6)$\sigma$. 


## Technical Innovations
The analysis employed sophisticated techniques to:
- Distinguish signal from the overwhelming QCD background
- Handle complex four-jet final states
- Develop model-independent search strategies
- Set limits on both resonant and non-resonant production scenarios in low-statistics regimes, where  asymptotic appproximations are no longer valid

## Results
This search achieved several significant milestones:
- First LHC limits on resonant pair production of dijet resonances via high-mass intermediate states
- Extended previous limits on supersymmetric particle scenarios
- Excluded diquark masses below 7.6 TeV in specific model scenarios
- Placed new constraints on top squark pair production in R-parity-violating supersymmetry

The analysis also revealed some tantalizing potential hints of new physics:
- Two remarkable events were observed with four-jet masses of 8 TeV and average dijet masses of 2 TeV
- These events showed a local significance of 3.9 standard deviations (reduced to 1.6σ when accounting for the look-elsewhere effect)
- Another interesting excess was observed at an average dijet mass of 0.95 TeV, with a local significance of 3.6σ (2.5σ global)
