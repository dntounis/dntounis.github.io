# Studying High-Energy Higgs Bosons in Association with Vector Bosons

## Analysis Overview

During my first research rotations at Stanford, and working with the SLAC ATLAS group, I contributed to the first measurement attempt of highly energetic ("boosted") Higgs bosons produced alongside $W$ or $Z$ bosons (collectively termed as vector bosons) with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, focusing on events where all particles in the final state manifest as collimated sprays of hadrons, known as jets.

## Technical Approach
The analysis employs several advanced experimental techniques to identify and measure these rare processes:

### Particle Reconstruction
- The decay products of both the Higgs and vector bosons are captured within single large-radius jets due to their high momentum
- Sophisticated jet substructure techniques analyze the internal patterns of these jets to distinguish between signal and background processes
- Specialized algorithms identify jets containing b-quarks from Higgs boson decays

### Background Estimation
- The dominant background comes from generic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) multijet production
- These background processes are measured directly from collision data rather than relying on simulation
- A likelihood fit to the jet mass distribution is used to separate signal from background

### Measurement Strategy
The analysis measures the production rate:
- Inclusively across all kinematic regions
- Differentially in three ranges of Higgs boson transverse momentum:
  - 250-450 GeV
  - 450-650 GeV
  - Above 650 GeV


## Results and Future Work

The measurement yields a signal strength relative to the Standard Model prediction of $\mu = 1.4+1.0-0.9 $, which translates to a production cross-section of $3.1 \pm 1.3(\mathrm{stat})^{+1.8}_{-1.4}(\mathrm{syst}) \ \mathrm{pb}$.


This measurement opens new possibilities for studying the Higgs boson in previously unexplored kinematic regimes and provides crucial insights into the Higgs mechanism at high energies, complementing existing measurements in other decay channels. 

Although the sensitivity of this analysis was not sufficient to measure Higgs production in this phase-space with adequate statistical significance, future improvements in the analysis techniques, as well as additional data collected during Run 3 of the LHC, will enable a more precise determination of the Higgs boson properties at high energies.
