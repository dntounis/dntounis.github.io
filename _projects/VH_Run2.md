As part of my work with the ATLAS Collaboration at CERN, I contributed to the first observation of highly boosted Higgs bosons produced in association with a vector boson (W or Z) in the fully hadronic final state. This groundbreaking analysis used proton-proton collision data corresponding to 137 fb⁻¹ collected at √s = 13 TeV.

Key aspects of the analysis:
- Novel reconstruction techniques:
 - Large-radius jets to capture boosted bosons
 - Advanced jet substructure methods for boson identification
 - Dedicated b-tagging algorithms for Higgs→bb decay
- Data-driven background estimation techniques
- Differential cross-section measurements in multiple Higgs boson momentum ranges:
 - 250-450 GeV
 - 450-650 GeV
 - >650 GeV

The analysis yielded:
- Signal strength relative to Standard Model: μ = 1.4⁺¹·⁰₋₀.₉
- Measured cross section: 3.1 ± 1.3 (stat) ⁺¹·⁸₋₁.₄ (syst) pb

This measurement opens new possibilities for studying the Higgs boson in previously unexplored kinematic regimes and provides crucial insights into the Higgs mechanism at high energies. The techniques developed for this analysis have broad applications in searches for new physics phenomena at high energy scales.
