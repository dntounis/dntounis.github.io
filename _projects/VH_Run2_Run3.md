# Search for Boosted Higgs Bosons in Associated Production with Vector Bosons


## Project Overview
This analysis builds upon our previous ATLAS study of highly energetic ("boosted") Higgs bosons produced alongside $W$ or $Z$ bosons, incorporating significant improvements in both dataset size and analysis techniques. The study focuses on events where all final state particles manifest as collimated sprays of particles called "jets", offering unique sensitivity to new physics effects at high energies.

## Technical Advancements
The analysis features several major improvements:

### Enhanced Dataset
- Combination of full Run 2 data with partial Run 3 statistics
- More than double integrated luminosity compared to previous analysis

### Advanced Reconstruction
- Implementation of latest b-jet identification algorithms with higher background rejection
- Novel b-jet mass regression techniques for improved mass resolution
- Refined jet substructure methods for better signal-background discrimination

### Methodology Improvements
- Sophisticated multivariate analysis techniques for event selection
- Enhanced background estimation methods
- Potential inclusion of vector-boson fusion (VBF) production category
- Implementation of dedicated high-transverse-momentum $p_{T}$ regime optimizations

### Theoretical Interpretation
- Extended analysis framework incorporating Effective Field Theory (EFT) operators
- Constraints on Wilson coefficients sensitive to high-momentum Higgs production
- Investigation of possible new physics contributions in the high-energy regime

## Physics Goals
The analysis aims to:
- Improve precision of $VH(b\bar{b})$ production cross-section measurement
- Probe potential deviations from Standard Model predictions at high energies by constraining relevant EFT operators through the unique sensitivity of the boosted topology 

## Impact
This measurement will:
- Enhance our understanding of Higgs boson interactions at high energies
- Provide crucial inputs for constraining possible new physics scenarios
- Demonstrate the capability of advanced reconstruction techniques

The analysis leverages the latest experimental and theoretical developments to maximize sensitivity to both Standard Model measurements and potential new physics effects.
