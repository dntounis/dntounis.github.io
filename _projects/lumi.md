A high-energy electron-positron collider is widely recognized as the crucial next step for detailed studies of the Higgs boson and other fundamental particles. As part of my graduate studies, I worked on analyzing the luminosity and beam-beam interaction characteristics of the Cool Copper Collider (C³), a novel linear collider concept.

The study focused on:
- Evaluating collision rates and luminosity potential
- Analyzing beam-induced background particles
- Comparing performance with other linear collider proposals
- Assessing the viability of beam delivery and final focus systems

Our analysis showed that C³ can achieve the same or higher collision rates compared to other proposals, while maintaining lower beam-induced background fluxes. These findings position C³ as a promising candidate for future particle physics research, leveraging technological advances in accelerator physics developed across various linear collider initiatives.

This work contributed to the broader effort of identifying the most suitable design for the next generation of particle colliders, which will be crucial for advancing our understanding of fundamental physics.
