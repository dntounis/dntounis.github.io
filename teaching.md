Throughout my undergraduate and graduate education, I've been passionate about Physics education and mentorship. This is essential not only for training the next generation of scientists but also for disseminating scientific knowledge to a wider audience and communicating the importance of scientific achievements. At Stanford, I've taken on both teaching and mentorship roles:

## Teaching Experience

- **Teaching Assistant**, PHYSICS 43 - Electricity & Magnetism  
  *Spring 2023 (04/2023 - 06/2023)*

- **Teaching Assistant**, PHYSICS 166/266 - Statistical Methods in Experimental Physics  
  *Winter 2024 (01/2024 - 03/2024)*

- **Teaching Assistant**, PHYSICS 152/252  
  *Spring 2024 (04/2024 - 06/2024)*

## Mentorship

- **Research Mentor**, Stanford Physics SURP Program  
  *Summer 2024 (04/2024 - 08/2024)*  
  Mentored a Stanford Physics sophomore student conducting research at SLAC through the Summer Undergraduate Research Program

- **Graduate Mentor**, Stanford University Physics Society (SUPS) Graduate Mentoring Program   
  *Fall 2024 - Present (10/2024 - ongoing)*  
  Mentoring a Stanford freshman student interested in pursuing a Major in Physics.

- **Graduate Mentor**, Stanford Physics inaugural Directed Reading in Physics (DRP) Program  
  *Spring 2025*  
  Mentored two Stanford freshmen students on the topic of "Illuminating the Higgs Boson with the CERN LHC" â€” held weekly meetings, assigned readings from journal articles, and helped prepare final presentations.
