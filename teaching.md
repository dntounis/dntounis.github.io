Throughout my undergraduate and graduate education, I've been passionate about Physics education and mentorship. This is essential not only for training the next generation of scientists but also for disseminating scientific knowledge to a wider audience and communicating the importance of scientific achievements. At Stanford, I've taken on both teaching and mentorship roles:

  *Spring 2023 (04/2023 - 06/2023)*

- **Teaching Assistant**, PHYSICS 166/266 - Statistical Methods in Experimental Physics  
  *Winter 2024 (01/2024 - 03/2024)*

- **Teaching Assistant**, PHYSICS 152/252  
  *Spring 2024 (04/2024 - 06/2024)*

## Mentorship

- **Research Mentor**, Stanford Physics SURP Program  
  *Summer 2024 (04/2024 - 08/2024)*  
  Mentored a Stanford Physics sophomore student conducting research at SLAC through the Summer Undergraduate Research Program
